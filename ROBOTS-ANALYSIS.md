# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian
The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at [https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on February 24, 2025
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /
User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /

## Explanation
This robots.txt file contains two sets of directives. The first applies to all web crawlers (User-agent: *) and includes a crawl-delay of 10 seconds between requests to reduce server load, along with an explicit permission to crawl the entire site (Allow: /). The second directive specifically targets SemrushBot (a crawler used by the SEO tool Semrush) and completely blocks it from accessing any part of the website (Disallow: /). This configuration indicates that The Daily Pennsylvanian welcomes most web crawlers but has specifically chosen to prevent Semrush's bot from analyzing their site, possibly to limit competitive SEO analysis.
